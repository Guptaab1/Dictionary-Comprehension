# Dictionary Comprehension
# In this example, we are putting the random number against each name in the list using dictionary comprehension
names = ["Alex", "Beth", "Caroline", "Dave", "Eleanor", "Freddie"]
import random
import pandas as pd

student_scores = {student: random.randint(1, 100) for student in names}
student_scores_df = pd.DataFrame(student_scores.items(), columns=["Name", "Score"])
print(student_scores_df)

# Here we are checking if the student get score greater than and equal to 60.
passed_student = {student: score for (student, score) in student_scores.items() if score >= 60}
print(passed_student)

# In this example, we will count the length of alphabet in the sentence we provide and then saving it into a new dictionary.

names = "what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
split_name = names.split()

print(split_name)

for name in split_name:

name_length = {name: len(name) for name in split_name}
name_length_df = pd.DataFrame(name_length.items(), columns=["Name", "Count"])
print(name_length_df)


# In this example we have one dictionary with key and value. From the value we convert the value from the Celsius into Fahrenheit.
